# XBS-nf

XBS-nf (compleX Bacterial Samples) is a pipeline for comprehensive genomic analyses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with a focus on clinical decision making as well as research. 

# Salient features of the implementation

- Fine-grained control over resource allocation (CPU/Memory/Storage)
- Reliance of bioconda for installing packages for reproducibility
- Ease of use on a range of infrastructure (cloud/on-prem HPC clusters/ servers (or local machines))
- Resumability for failed processes
- Centralized locations for specifying analysis parameters and hardware requirements
    - XBS-nf parameters (`default_parameters.config`)
    - Hardware requirements (`conf/standard.config`)
    - Execution (software) requirements (`conf/docker.config` or `conf/conda.config`)
- A GVCF reference dataset for ~600 samples
